IMPORTANT: Do NOT change, refactor, fix, or generate any code.

I need a full technical audit of this project for debugging and mentoring purposes.

Please analyze the CURRENT state of the project and report ONLY the following information:

1. PROJECT PURPOSE
   - What problem this application is intended to solve
   - Primary user flows (step-by-step, from a user’s perspective)

2. TECH STACK
   - Frontend framework/library (React, Next.js, plain HTML, etc.)
   - Backend framework/runtime (Node + Express, Flask, etc.)
   - Database used (if any)
   - Authentication method (if any)

3. PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - Folder structure (tree view)
   - Which folder is frontend
   - Which folder is backend
   - Entry files (e.g. index.js, server.js, main.py, etc.)

4. FRONTEND ↔ BACKEND CONTRACT
   - API base URL used by the frontend
   - All API endpoints currently expected by the frontend
   - HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
   - Expected request bodies
   - Expected response formats

5. CURRENT ERRORS & FAILURES
   - Exact runtime errors (copy verbatim)
   - Build errors (if any)
   - Console errors from frontend
   - Backend crash logs

6. SERVER STATUS
   - Is the backend server currently running?
   - If yes, on which port?
   - If no, what prevents it from running?

7. DATABASE STATUS
   - Is the database connected?
   - Are tables/collections created?
   - Any connection errors?

8. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   - List required environment variables
   - Which ones are missing or undefined

9. KNOWN INCONSISTENCIES
   - Mismatched ports
   - Missing routes
   - Incorrect imports
   - Frontend calling endpoints that don’t exist

10. WHAT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
   - Any routes that respond successfully
   - Any UI flows that partially work

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear headings
- Use bullet points
- Do NOT include opinions or guesses
- Do NOT suggest fixes
- Do NOT write code
- If something is unknown, explicitly say "UNKNOWN"

This report will be reviewed by a human mentor before any changes are made.
