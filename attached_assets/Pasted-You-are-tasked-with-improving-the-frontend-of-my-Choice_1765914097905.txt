You are tasked with improving the frontend of my Choice Properties website. The backend is fully modular and uses /api/v2/* endpoints for Properties, Applications, Payments, Leases, Admin, and Auth. Your goal is to implement high-quality frontend improvements for usability, polish, and role-based functionality, ensuring the site works properly with the current backend. 

Requirements:

1. Role-Based Dashboards:
   - Tenant: Show applications, saved searches, favorite properties.
   - Landlord: Show property listings, pending applications, payment status.
   - Agent: Show assigned properties, leads, notifications.
   - Admin: Show settings, audit logs, users, notifications.
   - Each dashboard should dynamically load data using the /api/v2/* endpoints.

2. Loading and Feedback Enhancements:
   - Implement skeleton screens for all lists and tables (properties, applications, payments, leases, admin tables).
   - Add inline form validation: highlight invalid fields, show error messages, and success notifications.
   - Ensure consistent toast notifications for all actions (success, error, warning).

3. Property Management UI:
   - Allow toggle between grid and list views for properties.
   - Add filters (price, bedrooms, property type) and sorting (latest, cheapest, most viewed).
   - Implement favorite/bookmark functionality with visual feedback.
   - Enhance property detail pages to show views, applications count, and payment info.

4. Application & Payment Flow UI:
   - Implement a step-by-step application wizard with a progress bar.
   - Display payment status clearly (verified/unverified) with color coding or icons.
   - Create a receipts page displaying payment history and downloadable PDFs.
   - Add confirmation modals for destructive actions.

5. Admin & Analytics:
   - Admin tables for users, audit logs, notifications, personas, and settings.
   - Inline editing for editable fields where applicable.
   - Powerful search and filters across all admin data.
   - Notifications panel for recent actions or alerts.

6. UX & Polish:
   - Standardize UI elements (buttons, spacing, cards, headings).
   - Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop.
   - Optional theme switcher (light/dark mode).
   - Sticky headers and floating action buttons for key actions.
   - Empty states with friendly illustrations/text.
   - Error boundaries to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

7. Small Enhancements:
   - Lazy-load images with low-res placeholders.
   - Format all dates in a readable format.
   - Loading indicators for form submission, file uploads, and payment verification.
   - Tooltips or help text for forms and dashboards.

Constraints:
- Do not add any paid services or premium features.
- Ensure every change works with the existing /api/v2/* endpoints.
- Maintain type safety where TypeScript is used.
- Make the site fully usable and visually polished for end-users.

Deliverables:
- Updated frontend pages and components implementing all requested improvements.
- Fully tested role-based dashboards and page functionality.
- All skeletons, loading states, error states, and form validation integrated.
- Site should be fully functional with the backend and show no API errors.

Please proceed to implement these frontend improvements, verify all pages work with the backend, and ensure the UX is professional and consistent across the site.
