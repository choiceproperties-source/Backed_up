TASK: Update Choice Properties website frontend for full polish, verification, and role-based workflows.

OBJECTIVE:
- Ensure the frontend fully works with the modular backend (/api/v2/* endpoints).
- Improve UX and make the app professional, cohesive, and fully functional.
- Focus on high-impact improvements without adding paid features or unnecessary extras.

SCOPE OF WORK:

1. API Integration:
   - Migrate all frontend API calls from legacy /api/* to /api/v2/* endpoints.
   - Verify proper error handling, loading states, and empty states for all API calls.
   - Ensure that role-based permissions on the backend match what is displayed in the frontend (Tenant, Landlord, Admin, Agent).

2. Skeleton Loading & UX Polish:
   - Implement skeleton screens for properties, landlord dashboards, agent dashboards, and application cards.
   - Replace all spinners with skeletons for faster-perceived loading.
   - Standardize empty states, loading states, and error states across all pages.
   - Enhance form validation feedback: inline error messages, red borders for invalid fields, success messages on submission.

3. Role-Based Workflow:
   - Show role-specific dashboards and pages:
     - Tenant: property search, applications, favorites, dashboard.
     - Landlord: property listing, application management, dashboard.
     - Admin: admin dashboards, personas, settings.
   - Ensure users cannot access pages outside their role.
   - Implement guided onboarding for new users to select their role at signup.

4. Notifications & Feedback:
   - Display notifications for key actions (application submission, payment verified, property approval).
   - Ensure email notifications (using existing backend logic) work correctly.
   - Add visual feedback on actions (success, error, or pending states).

5. Frontend Professionalization:
   - Ensure all pages are responsive and mobile-friendly.
   - Maintain consistent spacing, fonts, colors, and button styles across the app.
   - Optimize ImageKit integration (lazy-loading, proper sizing, modern formats).
   - Implement a top-level error boundary to catch unexpected crashes.
   - Verify accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, focus states).

6. Verification:
   - Test all pages, forms, and dashboards to ensure proper function with the /api/v2/* endpoints.
   - Check role-based access and ownership restrictions.
   - Confirm skeleton loaders, error states, and empty states behave correctly.

DELIVERABLES:
- Updated frontend code in `client/src/` fully integrated with /api/v2 backend.
- Functional skeletons, forms, and dashboards for all roles.
- Verified working app where every page and API call responds correctly.
- No errors or console warnings in the browser or server logs.
- Documentation updated if necessary (MIGRATION.md, replit.md).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not use paid services or features.
- Keep legacy routes (/api/*) untouched for backward compatibility.
- Keep all improvements high-impact and visible for the user experience.
