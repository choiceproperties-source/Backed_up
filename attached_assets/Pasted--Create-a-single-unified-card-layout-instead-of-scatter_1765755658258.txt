· Create a single, unified card layout instead of scattered sections
· Use consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme across all cards
· Implement a clear visual hierarchy with headings, subheadings, and body text

2. Visual Enhancement

· Add a prominent property photo gallery (these appear missing)
· Use icons consistently (some sections use different icon sets)
· Implement a clean color palette (3-4 primary colors maximum)
· Add subtle shadows/borders to cards for depth
· Use whitespace more effectively to reduce visual clutter

3. Mobile Optimization

· The current design appears mobile-focused but could be more responsive
· Ensure touch targets (buttons) are at least 44x44px
· Use a single-column layout for mobile with clear sections

📋 Content Improvements

1. Property Details Enhancement

· Add compelling headline: "Spacious 4-Bedroom Family Home with Large Backyard"
· Highlight key features first: "2,500 sqft • Big Backyard • Furnished"
· Expand description: Instead of just "4-bedroom house with a big backyard," describe lifestyle benefits
· Include neighborhood highlights: Proximity to schools, parks, shopping

2. Clarify Financial Information

· Combine all costs clearly:
  ```
  Monthly Rent: $4,200
  Security Deposit: $4,200
  Move-in Total: $8,400
  Estimated Monthly Utilities: $150
  ```
· Add value propositions: Compare to similar properties in area
· Include lease terms prominently: "12-month minimum lease"

3. Trust & Verification

· Consolidate verification badges into a single "Verified" section
· Add specific trust indicators:
  · "Background-checked landlord"
  · "Secure online application"
  · "Video tour available"
  · "24/7 maintenance guarantee"

4. Action Items

· Primary CTA: "Schedule a Tour" should be most prominent
· Secondary CTAs: "Contact Agent" and "Virtual Tour" options
· Tertiary action: "Save Property" or "Share with Roommates"
