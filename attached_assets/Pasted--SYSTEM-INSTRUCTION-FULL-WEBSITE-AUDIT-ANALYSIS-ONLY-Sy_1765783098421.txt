🔐 SYSTEM INSTRUCTION — FULL WEBSITE AUDIT (ANALYSIS ONLY)

System Mode: READ-ONLY / NO MUTATIONS

You are required to perform a comprehensive, deep, system-wide audit of this project.

⚠️ This is an analysis task only.
	•	Do NOT modify, refactor, generate, or delete any code
	•	Do NOT update configuration or environment variables
	•	Do NOT auto-fix or suggest code changes
	•	Do NOT run migrations or install packages

⸻

🔍 Audit Scope (Must Be Exhaustive)

Analyze every layer of the application, including:

1. Architecture & Structure
	•	Folder organization and modularity
	•	Separation of concerns
	•	Oversized or overloaded files
	•	Dead, unused, or duplicate code

2. Frontend
	•	Routing and page flow correctness
	•	Component reuse vs duplication
	•	State management correctness
	•	Performance risks (re-renders, heavy components)
	•	Accessibility gaps
	•	Broken or incomplete UI flows

3. Backend / Server
	•	API route clarity and collisions
	•	Middleware order and usage
	•	Error handling consistency
	•	Validation gaps
	•	Business logic leakage into routes

4. Authentication & Authorization
	•	Login/signup flow correctness
	•	Role-based access enforcement (tenant, landlord, agent, admin)
	•	Missing permission checks
	•	Frontend trust assumptions
	•	Session/token handling risks

5. Database & Supabase
	•	Query safety and efficiency
	•	Data model inconsistencies
	•	Over-fetching / under-fetching
	•	Missing constraints (conceptual)
	•	Race condition risks

6. Payments & Mock Payment Flow
	•	Logical correctness of payment lifecycle
	•	Failure and retry handling
	•	User messaging during errors
	•	Admin override logic risks
	•	Security assumptions

7. Storage & ImageKit
	•	Upload flow correctness
	•	Orphaned asset risks
	•	Access control boundaries
	•	Key exposure risks
	•	Client vs server responsibility split

8. Environment & Configuration
	•	Required environment variables
	•	Hardcoded secrets or unsafe fallbacks
	•	Missing validation
	•	Dev vs prod inconsistencies

9. Security
	•	Injection risks
	•	Missing rate limiting
	•	Sensitive data exposure
	•	Insecure defaults
	•	Over-permissive access

10. Performance & Scalability
	•	N+1 queries
	•	Blocking operations
	•	Excessive client requests
	•	Asset loading inefficiencies
	•	Caching opportunities (conceptual only)

11. Reliability & Observability
	•	Silent failure paths
	•	Missing logging
	•	Fragile logic
	•	Areas lacking test coverage

⸻

📑 Output Format (STRICT)

Return ONLY a structured audit summary:
	1.	CRITICAL ISSUES
Security, auth, payments, data integrity risks
	2.	HIGH-RISK ISSUES
Scalability, stability, or architecture problems
	3.	MEDIUM ISSUES
Performance, UX, maintainability concerns
	4.	LOW-PRIORITY / CLEANUP
Code smells, redundancy, organization

	•	Reference specific files or folders where applicable
	•	Do NOT include solutions or fixes
	•	Do NOT include code snippets

⸻

🎯 Purpose

This audit will be used to:
	•	Build a remediation roadmap
	•	Prioritize fixes
	•	Decide what to refactor vs keep

Again: analysis only, no changes.
