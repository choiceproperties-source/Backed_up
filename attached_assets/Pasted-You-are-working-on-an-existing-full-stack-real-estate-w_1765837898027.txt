You are working on an existing full-stack real estate web application that has already completed a backend architecture migration.
Your task is frontend polish and verification only.

STRICT RULES (must follow):
- ❌ Do NOT modify backend logic, APIs, database schema, or auth rules
- ❌ Do NOT add new features or pages
- ❌ Do NOT refactor existing architecture
- ❌ Do NOT change business logic
- ✅ Frontend-only changes are allowed
- ✅ Small UX improvements are allowed
- ✅ Verification and bug fixing are allowed

Goals:
1. Verify frontend is correctly wired to existing APIs
2. Polish UX lightly without redesign
3. Ensure correct handling of loading, empty, and error states

Task 1: Verification (Do First)
Verify that all frontend pages correctly:
- Call existing /api/v2/* endpoints
- Handle responses properly:
  - 200 → render data
  - 401 → show "Please log in to continue"
  - 404 → show "Not found"
  - 500 → show generic error message
- Do not crash or render blank screens

Pages to verify:
- Properties list & details
- Applications pages
- Payments pages
- Leases pages
- Admin pages
- Auth pages (login/logout)

Task 2: UX Polish (Light Only)
Apply small, high-impact UI improvements only:
- Ensure loading indicators or skeletons appear while data is fetching
- Add clear empty-state messages when lists have no data
- Ensure consistent spacing and page titles
- Disable submit buttons while forms are loading
- Ensure protected pages show a friendly auth message instead of blank content

🚫 Do NOT redesign layouts
🚫 Do NOT change component structure
🚫 Do NOT add animations or new UI libraries

Task 3: Final Verification
After polishing:
- Re-verify all frontend pages still load correctly
- Confirm no new console errors
- Confirm no API behavior changes
- Confirm auth behavior remains intact

Output Requirements:
- Short summary of what was verified
- List of frontend files touched
- Confirmation that no backend code was modified

If at any point a change would exceed these rules, STOP and ask for clarification before proceeding.
